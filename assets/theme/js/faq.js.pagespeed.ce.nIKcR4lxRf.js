By mass producing Groupon purchases, we're able to offer competitive deals. <br/><br/>Although the design choices may be limited, we still maintain the highest quality of materials and finish. <br/><br/>If you're looking for more colours, materials and sizes, we recommend looking through the complete collection on our website.","How do I get a refund on my Groupon voucher?":"You'll need to contact Groupon directly for your refund as they took the payment for your voucher: <br/><br/><strong class=\"color-b\">Groupon Tel Number</strong> <br/>0203 808 4223 (Monday to Friday - 8am to 6pm) <br/><br/><strong class=\"color-b\">Why can't you give me a refund?</strong> <br/>Unfortunately, we're unable to do this as we haven't taken any money from you. Because your transaction was with Groupon directly, we only receive payment from them after you've redeemed the voucher."}};var i={};e.insert('.col-4[data-v-49f08367]{padding:0}#answerResultsContainer[data-v-49f08367]{position:fixed;top:0;left:0;z-index:999999;width:100%;height:100%;background:rgba(0,0,0,.5)}#answerResultsContainer #answerResults[data-v-49f08367]{position:fixed;transform:translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);top:50%;left:50%;max-width:80%;max-height:80%;overflow:auto;background:#fff;padding:40px 70px}.close-box[data-v-49f08367]{position:absolute;right:32px;top:32px;width:32px;height:32px;opacity:.3;cursor:pointer}.close-box[data-v-49f08367]:hover{opacity:1}.close-box[data-v-49f08367]:after,.close-box[data-v-49f08367]:before{position:absolute;left:15px;content:" ";height:33px;width:2px;background-color:#333}.close-box[data-v-49f08367]:before{transform:rotate(45deg)}.close-box[data-v-49f08367]:after{transform:rotate(-45deg)}'),function(){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(i,"__esModule",{value:!0});var e=o(r),t=o(s);function o(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}}i.default={name:"faq-page-component",data:function(){return{selectedCategory:"Top 5 FAQs",showCategories:!1,questionCategories:{}}},methods:{showQuestions:function(e){this.selectedCategory=e,this.handleResize()},handleResize:function(){this.showCategories=document.documentElement.clientWidth>=1e3},structuredData:function(){var e={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:[]};return e.mainEntity=Object.values(this.questionCategories).map(function(e){return e.questions}).flatMap(function(e){return Object.values(e)}).map(function(e){return{"@type":"Question",name:e.question,dateCreated:"2018-01-01T20:07Z",author:{"@type":"Person",name:"UK Sign Shop"},answerCount:"1",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:e.answer,dateCreated:"2018-01-01T22:01Z",author:{"@type":"Person",name:"UK Sign Shop"}}}}),JSON.stringify(e)}},computed:{categories:function(){return Object.keys(this.questionCategories)}},created:function(){var e={};for(var o in t.default){var r="Top 5 FAQs"===o?"Top 5 Frequently Asked Questions":o;for(var a in e[o]={category:r,questions:{}},t.default[o])if(t.default[o].hasOwnProperty(a)){var s=this.$options.filters.slug(a);e[o].questions[s]={key:s,question:a,answer:t.default[o][a]}}}this.questionCategories=e;var i=document.createElement("script");i.type="application/ld+json",i.text=this.structuredData(),document.querySelector("head").appendChild(i),window.addEventListener("resize",this.handleResize),this.handleResize()},components:{FAQBlockComponent:e.default}}}(),i.__esModule&&(i=i.default);var n="function"==typeof i?i.options:i;n.render=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("div",[o("h1",{staticClass:"text-center"},[e._v("Help & FAQs")]),e._v(" "),o("h4",{staticClass:"col-xl-10 offset-xl-1 px-lg-3 text-center nw"},[e._v("\n        If you have a question our customer services are always happy to help.\n    ")]),e._v(" "),o("hr"),e._v(" "),o("div",{staticClass:"d-flex flex-wrap",attrs:{id:"faq-container"}},[o("div",{staticClass:"col-12 col-lg-4 pr-xl-3",attrs:{id:"faq-cats-container"}},[o("a",{attrs:{href:"javascript:void(0);",id:"show-faq-cats"},on:{click:function(t){e.showCategories=!0}}},[e._v(e._s(e.selectedCategory))]),e._v(" "),o("div",{directives:[{name:"show",rawName:"v-show",value:e.showCategories,expression:"showCategories"}],attrs:{id:"faq-cats"}},e._l(e.categories,function(t){return o("a",{staticClass:"faq-cat-item",class:{active:t===e.selectedCategory},attrs:{href:"javascript:void(0)",id:e._f("slug")(t)},on:{click:function(o){return e.showQuestions(t)}}},[e._v(e._s(t))])}),0)]),e._v(" "),o("div",{staticClass:"col-12 col-lg-8"},[o("FAQBlockComponent",{attrs:{items:e.questionCategories[e.selectedCategory]}}),e._v(" "),e._m(0)],1)])])},n.staticRenderFns=[function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("div",{staticClass:"text-center"},[t("h5",{staticClass:"nw"},[this._v("Can't find an answer?")]),this._v(" "),t("p",[this._v("Our friendly team are here to help.
